# Check the last updated dates of gov.uk content

1. Upload a .csv file with the paths you want checked
2. .csv must have a single column, with each row containing a path eg /foreign-travel-advice/spain, <strong>not</strong> a full URL like https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/spain
3. don't add a header row in the .csv, ie the first row should contain an actual path, not a title like 'Path'

After the file is uploaded, click Continue and a results .csv will be downloaded
